Here are the rules/code of conduct for this repository to prevent spam and/or low-quality PRs:

* When adding a PR, make sure it doesn't go against the purpose of this repository(implementing efficient Data Structures in Python).
* Make sure the code you add doesn't have technical errors in main.py(or else the module can't be usable).
* When adding code, make sure you run it with the Pypy GitHub workflow to ensure it adds into Pypy using twine.
* If adding documentation PRs, make sure you format the README documentation correctly.
* If you find an error in the twine/the internal functions of Pypy, then try to address the issue more in detail with images.

Thank you for all the contributions! Continue to collaborate to open source!
